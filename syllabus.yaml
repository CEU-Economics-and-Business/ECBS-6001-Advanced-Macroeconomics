description:
    content: The course introduces Markov processes and dynamic programming, two tools for forecasting dynamic processes and solving dynamic optimization problems. After introducing the key concepts and theoretical results, the tools will be immediately applied in quantitative computing using the Julia programming language.  
    relevance: Markov processes and dynamic programming are key tools to solve dynamic economic problems and can be applied for stochastic growth models, industrial organization and structural labor economics. Julia is an efficient, fast and open source language for scientific computing, used widely in academia and policy analysis.
