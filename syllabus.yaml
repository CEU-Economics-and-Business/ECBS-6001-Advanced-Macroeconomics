    -   name: Zsófia L. Bárány
        bio: Zsófia Bárány is associate professor at CEU. She is a macroeconomist interested in economic growth, technological change and its impact on the labor market. A large part of her work aims at understanding the driving forces behind long-run trends in the evolution of labor market outcomes, such as inequality, or job polarization, taking into account individual heterogeneity.

description:
    content: "The course introduces two building blocks of macroeconomic modeling: forward-looking dynamic models and general equilibrium with heterogeneous agents. These tools are applied to problems of economic growth, labor market search, and industry dynamics. Quantitative model solutions are also illustrated using the Julia programming language."  
    relevance: Dynamics and equilibrium are two building blocks of macroeconomic thinking. These approaches are essential for studying a wide range of problems in macroeconomics, labor economics, industrial organization, economic geography, international trade. 
learning_outcomes:
    - Analyze growth models including the Solow and Ramsey frameworks.
    - Evaluate endogenous growth theories and their implications.
    - Apply search and matching models to labor market analysis.
    - Analyze industry equilibrium with heterogeneous firms.
    - Understand the importance of input-output linkages in macroeconomic contexts.
    - Solve dynamic programming problems and ordinary differential equations using Julia.
