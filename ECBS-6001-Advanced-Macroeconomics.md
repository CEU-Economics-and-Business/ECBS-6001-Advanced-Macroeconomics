## 1. Course Description
### Content
The course introduces Markov processes and dynamic programming, two tools for forecasting dynamic processes and solving dynamic optimization problems. After introducing the key concepts and theoretical results, the tools will be immediately applied in quantitative computing using the Julia programming language.

### Relevance
Markov processes and dynamic programming are key tools to solve dynamic economic problems and can be applied for stochastic growth models, industrial organization and structural labor economics. Julia is an efficient, fast and open source language for scientific computing, used widely in academia and policy analysis.

## 2. Learning Outcomes
### Key outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Use difference equations to characterize 2-dimensional dynamic systems.
* Solve for the steady-state of 2-dimensional linear dynamic systems.
* Characterize the stability of 2-dimensional linear dynamic systems.
* Create plots in Julia.
* Understand the definition of Markov processes.
* Create functions in Julia.
* Simulate Markov processes in Julia.
* Understand the definition of Markov chains.
* Solve for ergodic distributions of Markov chains.
* Forecast Markov chains analytically.
* Apply arrays and matrix algebra in Julia.
* Simulate Markov chains in Julia.
* Understand the principle of dynamic programming.
* Derive the Bellman equation for several simple recursive problems.
* Solve for the value function using the guess and verify method.
* Solve the Bellman equation using value function and policy function iteration.
* Understand contraction mappings.
* Use while loops in Julia numerical iteration.
* Solve the Ramsey growth model using dynamic programming.
* Solve the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search model using dynamic programming.


### Other outcomes
The course will also help develop skills in the following areas.
